This is my personal website which will consist of the following sections:

1. Portfolio

5. Study

# Portfolio
The main page of this repository. It portrays a brief bio, education, and tech stack.

# Data Analysis Manual
This is a manual that I will be using for the rest of my career. It will start as a manual for data analytics and it will be constantly updated to try and cover the vast field of data (as best as I can).

This will be a repository that will contain the projects I've done either individually or as a team.  

This includes personal projects ranging from leveraging daily task automations to AI integration.

# Blog

# Study
This section will be a database to all of my study notes.
