## Introduction

The reason I decided to create this `Data Analysis Manual` is due to the sheer volume of information sources available today. While “data is the new oil,” the quality of this new oil can vary greatly, making it essential to discern credible methods from the noise. With so many perspectives on what constitutes the “industry standard” in data analysis, I took it upon myself to explore, study, and curate information from diverse sources. My goal is to build a customized framework for data analysis that aligns with my journey to becoming a data analyst—and, hopefully one day, an MLOps Engineer.

## Who is this for?

This Data Analysis Manual is designed for anyone with a foundational knowledge of Python, statistics, marketing, or basic machine learning. Whether you’re a beginner stepping into data analysis, a marketer seeking data-driven insights, or someone with a tech background exploring analytical techniques, this guide provides a structured approach to build upon your existing skills. My goal is to offer a clear, practical resource that helps you cut through the noise, focus on quality methodologies, and develop a deeper understanding of the analytical process in a way that’s actionable and relevant to your work.

## Where to start?

This manual is designed to be flexible, allowing you to jump to sections that address your immediate needs. Each part is crafted with concise explanations, making it easy to get a quick grasp of specific topics. However, to fully understand the bigger picture of data analysis, I recommend going through all sections at least once. Doing so will provide a cohesive view of the framework, tying together concepts and methods that build upon each other. Feel free to start with the topics that resonate most, but keep in mind that every part contributes to the comprehensive understanding you’ll need to master the use of this manual.

## Welcome

I’m thrilled to share this Data Analysis Manual with you. My hope is that this guide not only serves as a valuable resource on your journey but also sparks inspiration to create your own tailored manual, one that reflects the unique insights and methods you find most essential. Feel free to adapt, extract, and build upon the knowledge here to make it truly yours. Together, let’s navigate the world of data analysis with clarity, curiosity, and a commitment to quality.

## Acknowledgements

There are some people I consider mentors along my journey who have shaped much of what I know today. It is not like they know me personally however, I hold deep respect for them and wish to share their contributions with you:

**Dr. Angela Yu**: Python\
**Dr. David J. Malan**: Computer Science\
**Dr. Andrew Ng**: Machine Learning\
**Krista King**: Math (Algebra, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics)\
**Sal Khan**: Math (Statistics)\
**Grant Sanderson**: Math (Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calculus)

These mentors have not only provided knowledge but have also instilled in me the confidence to pursue my goals in data analysis. I’m grateful for their guidance and hope to carry forward the lessons I’ve learned from each of them.
